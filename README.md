### Packages Used & Why

Runtime dependencies:
- `react`, `react-dom`: Core UI library and DOM renderer for building the application.
- `@xyflow/react`: React bindings for XYFlow (formerly React Flow) to render interactive node-based graphs and manage nodes/edges/connectors.
- `tailwindcss`: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid, consistent styling.
- `@tailwindcss/vite`: Official Tailwind CSS v4 integration for Vite; enables on-demand CSS with zero-config DX.
- `react-icons`: Icon set convenience via React components for a lightweight, consistent iconography solution.
- `uuid`: Generates stable unique identifiers for nodes, edges, and persisted entities.
- `html-to-image`: Converts DOM elements to images (PNG/SVG/JPEG); useful for exporting the canvas/diagram snapshots.
- `install`: Utility for programmatic package installation; included here for tooling workflows where dynamic installation may be used.

Dev dependencies:
- `vite`: Fast dev server and build tool providing HMR and optimized production builds.
- `@vitejs/plugin-react`: Official React plugin for Vite with Fast Refresh and JSX optimizations.
- `typescript`: Type safety and developer tooling via static typing.
- `@types/react`, `@types/react-dom`: Type definitions for React and React DOM.
- `eslint`, `@eslint/js`, `typescript-eslint`, `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`, `eslint-plugin-react-refresh`, `globals`: Linting setup for consistent code quality, React Hooks rules, React Fast Refresh considerations, and shared globals.
